\begin{abstract}
We propose Self-Regulating Learning Pressure (SRLP), a training-time adaptive control
algorithm that stabilizes neural network optimization by dynamically modulating gradient
magnitude based on short-term loss volatility. SRLP is optimizer-independent and introduces
no additional forward passes. Experiments demonstrate reduced loss volatility, fewer loss
spikes, stabilized gradient norms, and preserved accuracy.
